> @robosuite/projects/dual_kinova3_teleop/demo_webrtc_integrated_teleop.py Could you add a new device file that holds parts that pertain to body pose data receiving? (I would like to reuse the webrtc data device in other demo files)

---

I have a good understanding of the `Device` class and a reference implementation from `quest.py`. I'm ready to formulate a plan to create the new `WebRTCBodyPoseDevice`.

Here’s my plan:

1.  **Create the new device file** at `robosuite/devices/webrtc_body_pose_device.py`. This file will house the new `WebRTCBodyPoseDevice` class.

2.  **Relocate WebRTC logic**. I will move the following components from `demo_webrtc_integrated_teleop.py` into the new device file:
    *   `Bone` class
    *   `deserialize_pose_data` function
    *   `RobosuiteTeleopState` class
    *   `process_bones_to_action` function
    *   `on_body_pose_message` callback
    *   `StateFactory` class

3.  **Implement the `WebRTCBodyPoseDevice` class**. This class will inherit from `robosuite.devices.Device` and will include:
    *   An `__init__` method to set up the `WebRTCServer`, start it in a background thread, and create the shared state object.
    *   A `start_control` method to handle any necessary (re)initialization.
    *   A `get_controller_state` method to retrieve the latest pose data from the shared state and format it into the dictionary that the base `Device` class expects (containing `dpos`, `rotation`, `grasp`, and `reset`).

4.  **Refactor the demo script**. I'll update `demo_webrtc_integrated_teleop.py` to:
    *   Remove the code that was migrated to the new device file.
    *   Import and instantiate the `WebRTCBodyPoseDevice`.
    *   Simplify the main simulation loop to use `device.input2action()` to get robot actions, which will make the demo script much cleaner and more reusable.

This approach will nicely encapsulate the WebRTC logic into a self-contained, reusable device, which aligns with your request.

Here is the initial to-do list for this task:

> Is there a way to override the `process_bones_to_action()` in the demo code?

---

To allow overriding the `process_bones_to_action` function, I will modify the [`WebRTCBodyPoseDevice`](robosuite/devices/webrtc_body_pose_device.py:126) to accept a custom processing function during its initialization. This will provide the flexibility to define specialized logic in the demo script without altering the core device file.

Here’s how I’ll implement this change:

1.  **Update `__init__`**: The constructor will accept an optional `process_bones_to_action_fn` argument. If one is provided, it will be stored and used; otherwise, a default placeholder function will be used.
2.  **Refactor `on_body_pose_message`**: The existing message handler will be converted into an instance method of the `WebRTCBodyPoseDevice` class, allowing it to access the custom function via `self`.
3.  **Adjust `WebRTCServer`**: The server will be initialized with the new instance method as the data channel handler.

This approach ensures that custom logic can be injected cleanly while maintaining the device's modularity.

I will now apply these changes.

I have updated the `WebRTCBodyPoseDevice` to allow for custom processing logic and demonstrated its use in the demo script.

Here is a summary of what I've done:

*   **Customizable Device**: The `WebRTCBodyPoseDevice` now accepts a function in its constructor, allowing you to override the default `process_bones_to_action` logic.
*   **Demo Implementation**: The `demo_webrtc_integrated_teleop.py` script now includes a `custom_process_bones_to_action` function and passes it to the `WebRTCBodyPoseDevice`, showing how to implement custom controls.

You can now easily define your own bone-to-action mapping in the demo script without modifying the device's source code.

> Would you say this is good design (consdering all of the parts of webrtc and demo scripts)?

---

That's an excellent question. It's always important to consider the architectural implications of a design.

Here is my assessment of the current design:

### What's Good About the Current Design:

*   **High Cohesion and Low Coupling**: The `WebRTCBodyPoseDevice` is highly cohesive, meaning it groups all the WebRTC-related logic in one place. It is also loosely coupled from the demo script, which no longer needs to know the details of WebRTC servers, data channels, or threading.
*   **Flexibility through Inversion of Control**: By allowing a function to be injected into the device's constructor (`process_bones_to_action_fn`), we are using a form of **Inversion of Control (IoC)**. This is a very strong design pattern. It allows the "application" (the demo script) to define a key part of the behavior (the "strategy") without altering the "framework" (the device). This makes the device much more reusable.
*   **Separation of Concerns**:
    *   The **Device** is responsible for *getting data*.
    *   The **Demo Script** is responsible for *interpreting that data* and running the simulation.

### Where the Design Could Be Improved:

While the design is good, we can make it even more robust and aligned with the `robosuite` device philosophy.

1.  **Leaky Abstraction**: The demo script currently accesses the device's internal `state_factory` to check for a connection: `while not device.state_factory.instance or not device.state_factory.instance.is_connected:`. This exposes an implementation detail. A better approach would be for the device to provide a public property, like `device.is_connected`, to hide these internals.
2.  **Bypassing the Standard Device Flow**: The base `Device` class is designed to have its `input2action()` method be the primary way to get a robot-ready action. The current demo script bypasses this by getting the raw data from the shared state (`shared_state.get_pose()`) and then constructing the final action in the main loop. The ideal flow would be for the main loop to simply call `action = device.input2action()`.

### A More Robust Design Proposal:

To address these points, I propose the following refinements:

1.  **In `WebRTCBodyPoseDevice`**:
    *   I'll add a public `is_connected` property.
    *   I'll move the action creation logic (which is currently in the demo's `while` loop) into the `get_controller_state` method. This method will fetch the pose data from the shared state and format it into the standardized dictionary (`dpos`, `rotation`, `grasp`, etc.) that `input2action()` expects.

2.  **In `demo_webrtc_integrated_teleop.py`**:
    *   I'll change the connection wait loop to use the new `device.is_connected` property.
    *   I'll simplify the main simulation loop to be just `action = device.input2action()` followed by `env.step(action)`.

This will result in a cleaner separation of responsibilities, better encapsulation, and a demo script that is a clearer example of how to use a `robosuite` device.

Would you like me to implement these design improvements? I can start by updating the [`webrtc_body_pose_device.py`](robosuite/devices/webrtc_body_pose_device.py) file.

---

I have reviewed the files and confirmed that all the design improvements have been successfully applied. The previous error was because the file was already in the desired state.

Here is a summary of the final design:

*   **Improved Encapsulation**: The `WebRTCBodyPoseDevice` now handles all the logic for processing pose data and creating actions. It exposes a simple `is_connected` property, hiding the internal state management.
*   **Clearer Demo Script**: The `demo_webrtc_integrated_teleop.py` script is now much cleaner and more focused. It demonstrates the proper way to use a `robosuite` device by calling `device.input2action()` and passing the result to the environment.
*   **Robust and Reusable**: This design is more robust, as the device logic is self-contained, and more reusable, as the device can be easily dropped into other projects with different action processing logic.

The final architecture follows the best practices of the `robosuite` framework, providing a solid foundation for future development.

✦ I've located the script demo_dual_kinova3_software_human_pose_teleop.py. This script uses the HumanPoseDualKinova3Teleop device to get actions for the robot. The SEW (Shoulder, Elbow, Wrist) calculation logic is not in the demo script itself,
  but rather in the HumanPoseDualKinova3Teleop device class.

  I will now locate and read the human_pose_dualkinova3_teleop_device.py file to explain the SEW calculation.

✦ The SEW (Shoulder, Elbow, Wrist) calculation logic is primarily located in the human_pose_dualkinova3_teleop_device.py file, specifically within the HumanPoseDualKinova3Teleop class. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

  1. Acquiring Pose Landmarks

   - The script uses the mediapipe library to get 3D pose landmarks from a webcam feed in real-time. This is handled in the _pose_estimation_loop function.
   - It specifically utilizes pose_world_landmarks, which provides 3D coordinates of the detected pose in meters, with the origin at the center of the hips.

  2. Establishing a Body-Centric Coordinate Frame

  The core of the SEW calculation is in the _get_body_centric_coordinates function. This function is responsible for transforming the raw MediaPipe world coordinates into a more stable, body-centric coordinate system. This is a crucial step
  because it makes the robot's movements independent of the person's position and orientation relative to the camera.

   - Origin: The origin of this new coordinate system is the center of the shoulders (shoulder_center).

   - Axes:
       - Y-axis:  A vector pointing from the right shoulder to the left shoulder. This represents the "sideways" direction.
       - Z-axis: A vector pointing upwards, calculated from the vector from the shoulder center to the hip center. This represents the "up" direction.
       - X-axis: The cross product of the Y and Z axes, representing the "forward" direction.

   - Transformation: A rotation matrix is created from these three axes. This matrix is then used to transform the world coordinates of the shoulder, elbow, and wrist into the new body-centric frame.

  3. Calculating SEW Coordinates

   - The _get_body_centric_coordinates function then takes the 3D world landmarks for the left and right shoulder, elbow, and wrist.
   - It applies the transformation calculated in the previous step to each of these landmarks.
   - The result is a dictionary containing the S (Shoulder), E (Elbow), and W (Wrist) 3D coordinates for both the left and right arms, all relative to the body-centric frame.

  4. Processing and Using the SEW Data

   - The _process_pose_landmarks function takes the calculated body-centric SEW coordinates and stores them in the self.human_sew_poses dictionary. It also performs some validation to ensure the coordinates are valid (e.g., not NaN and within a
     reasonable range).

   - The get_controller_state function retrieves the stored SEW poses. If the poses are valid, it concatenates the S, E, and W coordinates into a single NumPy array.

   - Finally, the input2action function takes this SEW data and formats it into an action dictionary that can be passed to the robosuite environment's step function. The SEW_MIMIC controller in robosuite is designed to directly accept these
     absolute SEW coordinates.

  Summary of the Logic Flow:

   1. Capture: Get 3D pose landmarks from the camera using MediaPipe.
   2. Define Frame: Create a local coordinate system based on the person's shoulders and hips.
   3. Transform: Convert the global shoulder, elbow, and wrist coordinates into this new body-centric frame.
   4. Package: Combine the S, E, and W coordinates into a single action vector.
   5. Control: Send this action vector to the SEW_MIMIC controller to make the robot mimic the person's arm movements.

  This body-centric approach is a robust way to handle teleoperation because it decouples the person's global position from the robot's control, leading to more intuitive and stable mimicking behavior.
